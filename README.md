# tycostream demo

An compact UI that connects to the [tycostream](https://github.com/tycoworks/tycostream) server via Apollo Client, and displays live PnL data in AG-Grid.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and the grid will connect to your GraphQL server at `ws://localhost:4000/graphql`.

That's it! ðŸš€
